# E-Commerce With Golang

An Ecommerce application with basic authentications like sign-up, login.

Built using Golang as the backend and MongoDb as database.

The goal is to build the front-end with Vue later.

The project as of now has different functionalities like:

        - Search for products
        - View a product detail
        - Add product  (admins)
        - Update product information.
        - Add product to cart
        - Remove product from cart etc.

Below are some of the endpoints demonstrated in the pictures and also you can download the api collection of the project.
